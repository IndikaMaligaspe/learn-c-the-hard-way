# liblcthw

Library built in exercises 32-47 of [Learn C the hard Way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/).

Although I understand that traditionally C libraries contain *lots of features*, IMO it would be better to create a
separate library for each concern, i.e. a linked list lib, a radix map lib, etc.

That way I can install and include exactly what I want, not a huge swiss army knife just because I need a toothpick.
